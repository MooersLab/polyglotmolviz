# polyglotmolviz
Code snippets to facilitate running several molecular graphics software packages in Colab notebooks.

Version 0.0.0


Chemists, biochemists, and pharmacologists frequently need to visualize the structures of both small and large molecules with molecular graphics software. Historically, this software has been expensive and proprietary. 
However, open-source alternatives are now widely available. 
In addition, several python packages support molecular visualization in Jupyter notebooks (e.g., rdkit, nglview, py 3 dmol, and PyMOL.). 
The first package supports 2-D views of small molecules. 
The following two packages provide interactive 3-D views of small molecules and proteins. 
The fourth package provides static images of 3-D molecular scenes that are of publication quality.
The first and last packages also support numerous kinds of structural analysis in addition to molecular visualization.
